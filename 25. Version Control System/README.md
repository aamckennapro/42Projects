# 25. Version Control System

You most probably are using Git. You might have used SVN or even CVS. Anyways, the idea is simple. Implement a new version control system. Aim for something better than Git.
Also, remember, Linus wrote the first version of Git in two weeks or so. Accept the challenge, write your VCS in less than 13 days. In your face, Torvalds!
