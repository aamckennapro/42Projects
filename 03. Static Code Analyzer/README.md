# 3. Static Code Analyzer

Static code analyzers are used to analyze (obviously) the source code without running it and discover issues that might lead to bugs in the running application. That way, running a static code analyzer for your project might save a lot of time in debugging. Serious projects or mission-critical systems use commercial static analyzers to check the code quality.
Design and implement your own static analyzer for any language of your choice.
