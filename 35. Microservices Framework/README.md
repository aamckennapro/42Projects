# 35. Microservices Framework

Design a pretty neat microservices framework that supports basic patterns and provides a set of implementations out of the box. Make sure you cover service discovery and microservices’ communication.
The more features you add to your framework, the better chances to win the challenge.
Choose any programming language you’d like.
