# 15. Automated News Presenter

You are going to like this one. Imagine the regular news readers, like Feedly. And now, picture the news presenter of CNN, talking about some breaking news, coronavirus, etc. Now, imagine a cartoon-like character, that reads news to you (to the user) like real presenters do.
Design and implement a software that collects news (generally, subscribes to RSS feeds set by the user), and reads them out loud as an animated news presenter.
