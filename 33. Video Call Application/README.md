# 33. Video Call Application

There are several video call applications, Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts.
But still, they work bad if the internet connection is poor. Maybe you should invent a new compression algorithm (see below) and combine it with this application to implement a new superb video call application? Not sure. Basically, this project represents PiperChat, design and implement the best quality video chat application out there.
