# 18. Virtual Assistant

Something like Siri, but without voice control. Just type a text, create reminders, ask questions, etc. The set of features is up to you, but the user must feel it as a solid virtual assistant application.
This project is intended for smartphones, that is, you should write it either for Android, or for iOS, or for both using some React Native/Flutter-like stuff.
