# 8. Web Browser

Sounds simple, but it’s not. First, it’s a GUI application. Next, it understands HTTP documents, and of course, it understands and properly renders HTML and CSS. And yes, it also executes JavaScript (at least the basic stuff).
So, no Chromium engine allowed. A plain web browser implemented from scratch. This one is tough. At least for me. You can skip some nasty parts and keep it basic, but still, it’s hard.
