# 10. Minimalistic OS

A dream of many. I know many programmers who dreamed to implement their own operating system from scratch. And one of the motivation for such suicidal intentions is to dive into the lowest levels of coding and getting familiar with metal. Everyone loves metal!
You can keep it simple, but at least implement several critical features for the OS. And do it from scratch, but you can have a look at the Linux kernel. After all, Linus had a look at Minix in some ways.
