# 39. Movie Recommendation System

It’s a lie, Netflix’s recommendation system sucks. Besides hand-picked lists of movies, I didn’t see a solid movie recommendation system anywhere.
Please, fix this madness. Design and implement the best movie recommendation system out there.
(You might need scraping a lot of databases to collect data on movies.)
