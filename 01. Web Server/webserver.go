package main

//import () // Going to need to import things eventually, just here for later

// Going to need a whole bunch of functions, probably a class/struct or two, and I foresee the use of channels as well.
// Likely going to start by implementing HTML/1.0, and will slowly work on bringing the server up to date with 1.1 and 2.0

/* STRUCTS */

// HttpRequest
// Socket
// Server
// Command -- for the cmd prompt

/* FUNCS */

/* MAIN */

// Note: Will only return index.html, 404.html, and 501.html.
// 404 is the "this page doesn't exist" page, and
// 501 is the "this page is currently under construction" page
