# 20. Dropbox Clone

Dropbox is a file sharing application. Consists of clients for almost all operating systems, including Android and iOS. It also has a huge backend. Design and implement your own version of a file sharing application that works at least for 10 users and provides 100 Mb of space to each of them. Implement both the server and the client (at least for one OS).
