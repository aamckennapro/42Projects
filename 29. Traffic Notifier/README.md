# 29. Traffic Notifier

Implement an app (or a service) that notifies the user about a traffic jam.
More than that, it suggest a better route to some destination (set by the user).
This is one of those applications that might serve as a good idea for a startup. Implement a really quality service and the success is guaranteed. You can combine this one with the virtual assistant introduced earlier, and the result will be marvelous.
