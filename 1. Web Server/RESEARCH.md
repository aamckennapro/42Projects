# RESEARCH.MD

Boy howdy this is my research document for Project 1, the Web Server. I've never built a web server, but I sure have been interested in them.

NGINX was recommended for inspiration, which is written in C, and here's that [source code](https://github.com/nginx/nginx).

[Python HTTP/1.1 Server](https://bhch.github.io/posts/2017/11/writing-an-http-server-from-scratch/)

[Building a Multi-Threaded Server in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)

[A Multi-Threaded Web Server](https://www.cs.carleton.edu/faculty/dmusican/cs348/webserver.html)

[An example repo of a Multi-Threaded Server in C](https://github.com/ozgurhepsag/Multi-threaded-HTTP-Server)

This is all that I've found so far, and it seems that I need to go the route of a multi-threaded web server.
