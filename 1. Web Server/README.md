# 1. Web Server

Prompt: Build a lightweight HTTP Web Server that processes incoming network requests over HTTP protocol. Web server processes and delivers web pages to clients (browsers). The pages are HTTP documents. The primary function may be to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of accepting content from clients (used for submitting form information or in accepting files for upload). Try to imitate [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) if in need of inspiration.
